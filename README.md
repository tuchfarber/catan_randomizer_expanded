# catan_randomizer_expanded

Previous Catan randomizer is built entirely in JS and runs client side. In some circumstances, it takes a considerable amount of time and processing ability (especially on mobile). In order to feel comfortable expanding this to generate 6 player boards, I decided to move this to a client-server model.

Working:

Not implement yet:
- Generate a random 4 player board
- Generate a random 6 player board
- Calculate ratings of board
- Generate based on requested ratings
